ArduinoLEDCube4x
================

This code is for controlling the 64 LEDs of a 4x4x4 LED cube via an Arduino Uno. 

Main features of this implementation:
- Print characters to your Arduino LED cube in a 7x4 font.
- Own font types can be created with the file BitFont_Generator_for_ArduinoLEDCube4x.xls .
- Multiplexing with a maximum of 16 LEDs turned on at any time.

Instructions for building a 4x4x4 LED cube are available e.g. here http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Cube-4x4x4/

The column and layer numbers may need to be adjusted in the code to the physical connection of the LED cube to the Arduino pins.
